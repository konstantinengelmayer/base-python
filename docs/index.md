A life without the free programming language R is no longer imaginable for many people and those who do not know R often do not know what they are missing.
Unfortunately, the widespread believe that R is difficult to learn still exists,
which makes it unnecessarily difficult for many newcomers to enter the world of R.
We would like to change this with this course.




# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should

* know and understand the basic properties of an object-oriented programming language,
* flexibly use your knowledge and understanding in various programming contexts, and
* have the basic programming skills for working in more complex subject-specific projects.


# Course features

This course is intended as a blended learning module in the study program of the Department of Geography at the University of Marburg.
However, the provided units and spotlights can also be used independently.
