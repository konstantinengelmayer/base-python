Control structures require arithmetic, logical, or boolean operators which test simple relationships between two or more variables. Depending on the test results, control structures can be used to decide how the program should proceed. Common examples include arithmetic (e.g., addition), comparison (e.g., "greater than" with >), and logical operations (e.g., AND, also written && in some languages).

>| Operator  | Description                          | Example     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Arithmetic Operators**                         ||
| +         | Addition                             | `x + y`     |
| -         | Subtraction                          | `x - y`     |
| *         | Multiplication                       | `x * y`     |
| /         | Division                             | `x / y`     |
| **        | Exponentiation                       | `x ** y`    |
| %         | Modulus (x mod y)                    | `x % y`     |
| **Relational Operators**                         ||
| <         | Test if x is smaller than y          | `x < y`     |
| >         | Test if x is greater than y          | `x > y`     |
| ==        | Test if x is exactly equal to y      | `x == y`    |
| >=        | Test if x is greater than or equal to y | `x >= y` |
| <=        | Test if x is smaller than or equal to y | `x <= y` |
| !=        | Test if x is not equal to y          | `x != y`    |
| **Logical Operators**                            ||
| not       | Logical NOT                          | `not x`     |
| &         | Element-wise logical AND             | `x & y`     |
| and       | Logical AND                          | `x and y`   |
| \|        | Element-wise logical OR              | `x | y`     |
| or        | Logical OR                           | `x or y`    |

<ul>
    <li>Relational operators are used to compare between values.</li> <br>

    <li>Logical operators are used to carry out Boolean operations like AND, OR etc. Such operators compare two variables and return true or false depending on the result of the comparison.</li><br>

    <li>Operators `&` and `|` perform element-wise operation producing result having length of the longer operand. <br><br> But `and` and `or` examines only the first element of the operands resulting into a single length logical vector.</li>
