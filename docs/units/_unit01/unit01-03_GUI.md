## User Interface

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unit_images/u01/gui_rstudio_exp.png" caption="RStudio User Interface" %}

This is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It contains
* a syntax-highlighting text editor *(1. Script)* - this is where the code is written.
* a console to execute code *(2. Console)*, - this is where results and errors are displayed.
* a workspace and history management *(3. Environment)*, - this is where stored variables, dataframes etc. are shown.
* tools for plotting and exporting images *(4. Graphical Output)* but also browsing the workspace, managing packages and information about the help functions within RStudio.
