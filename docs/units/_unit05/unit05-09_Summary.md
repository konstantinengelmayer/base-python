What we learned so far:


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unit_images/u03/types_objects.PNG" caption="Visualization of the connection of data types and objects." %}

Raw data is categorized in different scales, which are expressed in different data types, which can be stored in different object types.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unit_images/u03/objects.PNG" caption="Note the different data types which can be stored in the objects." %}

Note the specific data types of objects:
* Vectors must be of the same data type.
* Matrices must be of the same data type.
* Data frames must be arranged that columns are of the same data type.
* Lists can contain any data type.
* Factors can contain only strings.
